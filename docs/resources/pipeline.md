# warpstream_pipeline (Resource)

This resource allows you to create pipelines.
For more details, take a look at: https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/benthos

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    warpstream = {
      source = "warpstreamlabs/warpstream"
    }
  }
}

provider "warpstream" {
  token = "aks_xxx"
}

resource "warpstream_virtual_cluster" "tf_example_pipelines" {
  name = "vcn_tf_example_pipelines"
}

resource "warpstream_pipeline" "example_pipeline" {
  virtual_cluster_id = warpstream_virtual_cluster.tf_example_pipelines.id
  name               = "example_pipeline"
  state              = "running"
  configuration_yaml = <<EOT
  input:
    kafka_franz:
        seed_brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
        topics: ["test_topic"]
        consumer_group: "test_topic_cap"

    processors:
        - mapping: "root = content().capitalize()"

  output:
      kafka_franz:
          seed_brokers: ["localhost:9092"]
          topic: "test_topic_capitalized"
  EOT
}
```

To understand how to set your configuration take a look at: https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/configuration/benthos#getting-started
- `name` (String) The unique human-readable name of the pipeline within the virtual cluster. This cannot be changed after creation.
- `state` (String) The desired operational state of the pipeline. Valid values are 'running' or 'paused'.
- `virtual_cluster_id` (String) The ID of the virtual cluster associated with the pipeline.

### Read-Only

- `configuration_id` (String) The unique identifier of the pipeline configuration, automatically generated by WarpStream upon creation.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the pipeline, automatically generated by WarpStream upon creation.
